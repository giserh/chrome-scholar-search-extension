## Google Scholar Search Extension for Chrome

When you come across a name or a paper on a web page, you can select it and right-click to search on [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com).

### Installation

This repo holds the source code. The Chrome CRX package files are kept in [another repo](https://github.com/lintool/chrome-scholar-search-extension-crx), but you can download the latest version (0.1) [here](https://github.com/lintool/chrome-scholar-search-extension-crx/blob/master/chrome-scholar-search-extension-v0.1.crx?raw=true).

To install the Chrome extension:

1. Download the CRX package from the link above.
2. Open a new tab in Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions` in the address bar (omnibox).
3. Drag the CRX package you downloaded from step (1) into the tab.
4. That's it!

### Usage

Whenever you come across a name or a paper title you would like to look up on Google Scholar, select the text and right click: you'll see options for either searching by name (profile) or by title.
